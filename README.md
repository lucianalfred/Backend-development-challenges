Some Java Back-End development challenges, created with the goal of training, continuous practice, and technical improvement.

In addition to the back-end, in some projects I also developed the front-end, using SPA with Angular, to have a more complete view of the application.

As back-end developers, we know that showing our work is not simple, since much of what we do happens "behind the scenes" and is not immediately visible to others.

Therefore, having a portfolio of projects — even if it's back-end — is extremely important, as it demonstrates our skills in practice, our way of thinking about solutions, and can open doors to new professional opportunities.

As a bonus, including the front-end in some projects not only enriches the portfolio but also provides a complete experience in the application development cycle. This entire process significantly contributes to improving programming, architecture, and system integration skills.
